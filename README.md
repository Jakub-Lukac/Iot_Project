# Iot_Project
Arduino and Blynk Project

# Repository structure
As a team, we decided that his GitHub repository would be used for both code as well as all the other documentation like pictures, notes, etc.
It will consist of two folders, Code and Documentation.

# Introduction
The device addresses the need to monitor and maintain quality living conditions in university accommodations and homes, aiming to prevent issues like mold growth. It also benefits elderly individuals living in cold homes by improving their health and social well-being.

# Project Solution
The project creates a room monitoring system for living spaces lacking environmental monitoring. It tracks temperature, humidity, and light levels using microcontrollers and physical sensors, with a screen and optional mobile app for accessibility. Resources are openly available on GitHub for collaboration and transparency. 

# Project Requirements
•	Measure temperature.
•	Measure humidity.
•	Measure air quality index.
•	Connect and send data through any specified Wireless connection (Wi-Fi), including eduroam (WPA2 Enterprise).
•	Display current state through display located on the front of the console.
•	Display current state through mobile application
