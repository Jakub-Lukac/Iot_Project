# Iot_Project
Arduino and Blynk Project

# Repository structure
As a team, we decided that his GitHub repository would be used for both code as well as all the other documentation like pictures, notes, etc.
It will consist of two folders, Code and Documentation.

# About our project
- here we have to basically write the same thing but shorter, which we will write in our documentation (section Summary of Project)
